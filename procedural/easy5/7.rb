# Input: String of one or more space-seperated words
# Output: Hash with count of words in input by word size
# Rules:  Words are any string of characters w/o a space.
          # Non-alphabetic characters don't count

# Data structures: string, Hash

# Logic:  split to array of words
#         map to array of lengths
#         map to Hash
#             key = length
#             value = count
